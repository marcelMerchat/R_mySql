###   Summary
We examine the project review scores for a group of students that are recorded in a MySQL database. The database is queried and managed by the RMySQL R package that passes Structured Query Language (SQL) commands and queries to it and receive information from the database returns. The SQL commands are highlighted in red.

##library(dplyr)

## Prepare the database for use

## mysqlconnection <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user = 'root', password = ' ', dbname = 'studenttest',
   ##                         host = 'localhost')

all_cons <- dbListConnections(MySQL())
for(con in all_cons) 
  dbDisconnect(con)

```

<br><br>

### (a) Connect to Database

We connect to the MySQL database passing the MySQL user name and password. The function below returns an object or handle called "mysqlconnection.

```{r connect, echo=TRUE}

mysqlconnection <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user = 'root', password = 'ialsql1851', dbname = 'studenttest',
                            host = 'localhost')
```

<br><br>

### (b) Relational Database Structure

<br><br>

#### Tables
The relational database for the students has six tables named absences, classes, reviews, scores, students, and tests. The student review information is in a table called  "reviews." 

```{r list_tables, echo=TRUE}

dbListTables(mysqlconnection)

```

<br><br>

#### Student Records  

We first examine the general table for student information. 

```{r studentrecords1, echo=TRUE}

print(dbGetQuery(mysqlconnection, "select student_id, first_name, last_name,
                 city, state, zip from students where student_id < 9;"))

```

<br><br>

#### The Review Table
This table has four columns or fields of information. Notice the important data type property for each column. The student_id column is designated "PRI" which indicates that it is a primary key for the database.

```{r reviewcolumns, echo=TRUE}
print(dbGetQuery(mysqlconnection, "Describe reviews;"))


```


<br><br>

### (c) SQL Commands and Queries

<br><br>

#### Review Data
Four of the students have scheduled review appointments.  Notice that the Student with ID Number 4 has a review score of 75.

```{r initialscores, echo=TRUE}

print(dbGetQuery(mysqlconnection, "select * from reviews;"))

```

<br><br>

#### Change Grade for Student-4
The score of Student Number 4 has been changed from 75 to 80.

```{r printupdate1, echo=TRUE}

dbSendQuery(mysqlconnection, "Update reviews set score=80 where student_id = 4;")
print(dbGetQuery(mysqlconnection, "select * from reviews;"))

```

<br><br>

#### Summary Statistics

We exploit basic statistics capability of the MySQL database to compute the average score. We could have imported the scores into the R-program to accomplish this too. But it best to use the database as much as possible for analysis so we would not have to be more concerned about protecting student privacy.

```{r avgcompute, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

Review_Statistics <- dbGetQuery(mysqlconnection, "Select
                  Max(score) AS Maximum,                 
                  AVG(score) AS Average,
                  MIN(score) AS Minimum
                  from Reviews;")

```

<br><br>

### (d) Statistics

<br><br>

#### Average Student Score

```{r printavgscore, echo=TRUE}

Review_Statistics <- dbGetQuery(mysqlconnection, "Select
                  Max(score) AS Maximum,                 
                  AVG(score) AS Average,
                  MIN(score) AS Minimum
                  from Reviews;")

print(Review_Statistics)


```



<br><br>

#### Histogram of Student Scores
However, as needed we can use the R program to anaylse student data further as in the following histogram.

```{r getdata, echo=TRUE}

student_scores <- dbGetQuery(mysqlconnection, "select score from reviews;")

```

```{r prepare_histogram, echo=FALSE}

histogram_1 <- ggplot(student_scores, aes(score)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill="deepskyblue" ) +
      ggtitle("Review Scores") +
  
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color="#993333", size=24, face="bold.italic"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(color="#993333", size=22),
    axis.title.y = element_text(color="#993333", size=22),
    text = element_text(size=20),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#EFE5E5", colour = "brown",
    size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#E0DADA"))

```

```{r histogram, echo=TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, results='asis'}

histogram_1

student_scores <- dbGetQuery(mysqlconnection, "select score from reviews;")

print(student_scores)

all_cons <- dbListConnections(MySQL())
for(con in all_cons) 
  dbDisconnect(con)

```
